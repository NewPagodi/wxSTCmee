todo:
- redo styled text editor dialog to use a styled text control instead of a text control.
- cut external links out of and minimize the scintilla documentation
- add manually declared methods and methods inherited from textentry/textarea
- do the initial loading of the web pages on idle instead of in the constructor.
- when AnnotationClearAll is called with event logging, it can generate so many
  events that the logging will freeze and crash the program.  I should come up with
  some way to see if the change events are being logged and temporarily disconect
  the event hander if they are.

partially done:

maybe todo:
- add a second propgrid that tracks things: marker handles, registered autocompletion images,
  keys that have been bound, document handles, etc.
- maybe if the RGBA editor dialog is called a second time I should restore the
  last set of pixels
- in key bindings under cmd enum add a (full list) option that will popup a dialog
  with a complete list of commands that can be bound (maybe organized in a tree structure).

done:
- finish various things that involve manually styled text using
  the new styled text dialog.
- finish handles for lexer
- finish handlers for key bindings
- documents created with SCI_CREATELOADER(int bytes) should be added to
  the documentRefCnt map.
- add 3rd column for scintilla names
- get stc documentation window working
- rename everything from scintilla names to stc names and add scintilla names for 3rd
  column
- figure out why lexer.cpp takes so long to compile and cut down on compilation time.
