## wxStyledTextCtrl Method and Event Explorer 

The purpose is this piece of software is to allow the user to explore the properties and methods of the wxStyledTextCtrl Class. 

In order to compile, a version of wxWidgets recent enough to include wxAui, wxPropertyGrid, and wxWebView is needed.  I believe most versions since 2.9 should work.  

See the file doc/doc.md for more details.

This software makes use of the following:
 - the wxStyledTextCtrl documentation is used in accordance with the terms of the wxwindows free documentation licence.  See the files credits.txt and wxWidgets\licendoc.txt for more details.
 - the Scintilla documentation and icons are used in accordance the Scintilla license.  See the files credits.txt and scintilla\License.txt for more details.
